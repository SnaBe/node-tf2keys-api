**Have a question about the module or programming in general? *Do not create a GitHub issue.* GitHub issues are for feature requests and bug reports. Instead, send an email to support@tf2keys.net. Such issues may be ignored!**

The [API](http://tf2keys.net/api) is built to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we've created this [module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tf2keys-api) & repository to make it easier for you to interact with [TF2Keys.net](http://tf2keys.net) and the price requesting aspect of its API.
 
The example folder includes: 
- Requesting & saving price data for TF2 items. 
- Using the price data for a TF2 trade bot & displaying it on a website.

All examples require a valid API Key, you can get yours at TF2Keys.net/settings.
