# tf2keys-api

The API is built to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we've created this module & repository to make it easier for you to interact with TF2Keys.net and the price requesting aspect of its API.
 
The example folder includes: 
- Requesting & saving price data for TF2 items. 
- Using the price data for a trade bot & for display on a website.

All examples require a valid API Key, you can get yours at TF2Keys.net/settings.
