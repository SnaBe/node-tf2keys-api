# tf2keys-api

This repository is made to document the use of the TF2Keys.net API, both for regular- & premium users.

The example folder includes a example for requesting prices for use in a trade bot and for display on a web page. 

All examples require a valid API Key, you can yours at TF2Keys.net/settings
