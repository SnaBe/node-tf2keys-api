# tf2keys-api

The API is built to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we've created this repository to document the use of the TF2Keys.net API in more detail, both for regular- & premium users.

The example folder includes: 
- Requesting data for item pricing, for a trade- bot & for display on a website.

All examples require a valid API Key, you can get byours at TF2Keys.net/settings, you can paste it your config file for easy use.
